## About

The goal is to convert smart contract code into UML diagrams to help users intuitively understand the structure and processing steps of smart contracts.
UML is a general-purpose, development-oriented modeling language that is often used to visually illustrate the structure and behavior of systems, and UML diagrams can be automatically generated based on code.
When implementing a platform, care should also be taken to ensure simplicity, modularity, fairness, and verifiability similar to those required for smart contracts.
Smart contract information is obtained from EtherscanAPI, and the package [sol2uml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sol2uml) is used to generate the UML.
Contributions are very welcome!
